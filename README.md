## Description

A simple full-stack **task manager** built using:

- 🖼️ **Angular**, **Angular Material** and **Bootstrap** for the frontend
- ⚙️ **C# ASP.NET Web API** for the backend
- 🗃️ **PostgreSQL** as the database
- 🐳 **Docker** to dockerize as the things

Not all tools were strictly necessary, some were included to explore best practices and expand our tech exposure.

---

## 🛠️Features

- ✅ Add tasks
- 📝 Edit tasks
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 📌 Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

There’s no authentication or user system, just a clean CRUD implementation to practice full-stack architecture and collaboration.
