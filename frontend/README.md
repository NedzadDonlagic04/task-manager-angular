# Frontend Setup

Once the repository is cloned and you're inside the **frontend** directory, run the commands below:

## Restore dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the application:

```bash
npm run start # or alternatively ng serve
```

# Docker Setup

There is no additional work needed to use **docker-compose** to run the frontend service. The **docker-compose.yaml** file will build the Docker image and start the container for you automatically.
