## Description

A simple todo list app (called **task manager** to sound smarter than it is).

Built using:

- üñºÔ∏è **Angular**, **Angular Material** and **Bootstrap** for the frontend
- ‚öôÔ∏è **C# ASP.NET Web API** for the backend
- üóÉÔ∏è **PostgreSQL** as the database
- üê≥ **Docker** to dockerize as the things

Not all tools were strictly necessary, some were included just because we wanted to use them.

## Application Features

Simple CRUD functionality for tasks, frontend and backend validation and frontend filtering.

## Getting Started

This repo contains a [frontend](./frontend) and a [backend.api](./backend.api) folder, each with its own `README.md` containing specific setup instructions.

To get started clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NedzadDonlagic04/task-manager-angular.git
cd task-manager-angular
```

After you setup the projects in the aforementioned folders you should be able to run everything without issue.

## Docker Compose Setup

This project uses Docker Compose to run the entire application stack.

### Configure Frontend and Backend

Follow the setup in these 2 projects before continuing.

### Configure Environment Variables

Before you start, you need to provide the credentials for the PostgreSQL database. For security, these are managed using an environment file.

Create a file named **.env.db** in the root directory of the project. If you change the name of this file make sure you **DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT.**

Contents of the file should be in this format:

```
DB_USER=your_db_username
DB_PASS=your_db_password
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_db_name
```

### Run the Application

If you have a local PostgreSQL instance running, you may need to stop it to avoid port conflicts.

```bash
# Example for a Linux system
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

After configuring your environment variables, build and run the entire application with a single command.

The `--env-file` flag is necessary because your environment variables are stored in a file with a custom name.
If you leave the name just ass **.env** you don't need to pass it like this to the command.

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.db up --build
```
