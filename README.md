## Description

A simple full-stack **task manager** built using:

- 🖼️ **Angular**, **Angular Material** and **Bootstrap** for the frontend
- ⚙️ **C# ASP.NET Web API** for the backend
- 🗃️ **PostgreSQL** as the database
- 🐳 **Docker** to dockerize as the things

Not all tools were strictly necessary, some were included to explore best practices and expand our tech exposure.
